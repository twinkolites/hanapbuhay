- All tables have RLS enabled
- Role-based access control implemented
- Secure file upload policies
- Admin-only access to sensitive data

## Maintenance Queries

### Check RLS Status
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
ORDER BY tablename;
```

### Check Policy Count
```sql
SELECT tablename, COUNT(*) as policy_count
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
GROUP BY tablename
ORDER BY tablename;
```

### Check for Performance Issues
```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname
FROM pg_policies
WHERE qual::text LIKE '%auth.uid()%' 
   AND qual::text NOT LIKE '%(SELECT auth.uid())%'
ORDER BY tablename;
```
